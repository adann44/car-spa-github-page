# car-spa-github-page

Got it — you want a README that’s **clear, friendly, and non-technical**, so a business owner could understand what this site is, how to keep it updated, and how you can help them with similar projects.

Here’s a good starting point you can drop into your repo:

## 📞 Need Help?

This site was built with the help of **ChatGPT** and a human who understands both business needs and technology.

If you:

* Struggle with technology

* Need updates without hiring a full-time web designer

**Let’s connect!** I can set up and customize your site for your business, whether you’re a detailer, baker, photographer, or any other trade.

If you’d like, I can also add a **“How to update this site without breaking it”** quick guide in the README with screenshots so even someone totally new to GitHub can feel confident editing their own site.

Do you want me to add that step-by-step with screenshots? That would make this README even more business-owner friendly.
